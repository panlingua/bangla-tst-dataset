# Multingual Text Style transfer datasets
## Introduction
<p align="justify">
We present a novel Bangla dataset that facilitates text sentiment transfer, a subtask of Text style transfer (TST), enabling the transformation of positive sentiment sentences to negative and vice versa. To establish a high-quality base for further research, we refined and corrected an existing English dataset of 1,000 sentences for sentiment transfer based on Yelp reviews, and we introduce a new human-translated Bangla dataset that parallels its English counterpart.
